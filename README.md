# EE559--Machine-Learning
Welcome to the repository for my **Machine Learning (EE-559)** assignments! This repository contains all my solutions to the assignments in the course, focusing on classic machine learning algorithms and deep learning using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. Each assignment demonstrates my ability to implement and apply machine learning models, handle datasets, preprocess data, and evaluate the performance of models using various metrics.

## Key Techniques
1. **Supervised Learning**:
   - Regression (e.g., Linear and Logistic Regression).
   - Classification (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, KNN).
   
2. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN).
   - Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA).
   
3. **Deep Learning**:
   - Neural Networks using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**.
   - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
   
4. **Model Optimization**:
   - Regularization techniques (L1, L2).
   - Cross-validation, Grid Search, and Random Search for hyperparameter tuning.
